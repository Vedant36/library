Before the pandemic, the students of CMI had a personal library, The Student's Library. Originally most of the books were provided by CMI, but then students started donating books they didn't have use for. Those books now lie in the 3 cupboards in the Common Room. I have the keys now. Check the list of books[1], and meet me(or someone else i gave the keys to) on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 1800-1830 hrs with the CMI ID to borrow stuff. The protocol for borrowing is on the same site. Just `ctrl-f' on the site to look for books for now. The library has everything from fiction(which the CMI library lacks), books on math, physics and cs to bengali books(i actually dont know which language they are) and magazines.

Also, if you have any books you don't have use for, please consider donating them our library. You'll be rewarded with a custom note(within sensible limits) in front of the name of the book.

Also, please remember to return the books a week before the semester ends.
